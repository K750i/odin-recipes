# Introduction

Welcome to my bare-bone recipe website project! This project is part of an educational journey in HTML using [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple and functional platform for all your cooking needs. It features a collection of easy-to-follow recipes, each with its own ingredients list and step-by-step instructions. 

We hope this will inspire and help you in your culinary adventures. Happy cooking!
