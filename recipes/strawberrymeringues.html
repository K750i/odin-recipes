    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Channel Willy Wonka and surprise Santa when you combine two sweet treats.
        Here, a festive meringue that tastes like a strawberry malt.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Freeze-dried Strawberries</li>
        <li>Egg Whites</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Tartar Cream</li>
        <li>Malted Milk Powder</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Red Gel Food Colouring (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Fit a large round
            pastry tip in a pastry bag. Set bag, tip</li>
        <li>Pulverize freeze-dried strawberries in a food processor. Measure out
            3 tablespoons strawberry powder. Use any leftovers for dusting the
            plate or another use. </li>
        <li>Whisk together egg whites and sugar in a bowl set over a pot of
            simmering water. Whisk until sugar has dissolved, about 4 minutes.
            Transfer to a large bowl. Add cream of tartar. Beat with an electric
            mixer at low speed until mixture starts to foam. Continue beating at
            high speed until glossy and stiff peaks form (tips stand straight).
            Fold in 3 tablespoons strawberry powder, milk powder, and vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>Paint stripes of red gel food coloring (if using) inside the pastry
            bag. Carefully fill pastry bag with meringue mixture. Dot corners of
            a baking sheet with meringue, then line with parchment paper. (The
            dots will keep the paper in place.)</li>
        <li>Pipe quarter-size meringue dollops on the baking sheet, pulling bag
            straight up and spacing about 1 inch apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meringues are firm and easily peel
            off the parchment, 60 to 75 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
